# 7SegmentDisplay
Playing around before watching [Tom Scott's](https://www.youtube.com/user/enyay) [video about writing on 7-segment displays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4BMR88260).

Having watched the full video, I took a slightly different character set (allowed G, disallowed S and Y for being ambiguous with 5 and 4) and came up with a slightly longer word at 25 characters.

Oh... and I spent _far_ too long messing around getting words to be printable before actually checking anything!  Ironically ([see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OPkGQoPeHk)), there don't seem to be any emoji or unicode symbols to represent 7-segment displays.

It's not as readable without the fancy graphics but see if you can work it out... _Answer at the bottom of src/main.ts if you can't._
